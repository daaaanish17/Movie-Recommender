# Movie-Recommender
A movie recommendation system built using cosine similarity algorithm.


#### Data Preprocessing:

1.) Data Preprocessing:
At first, the dataset is cleaned.
After data cleaning, I combined overview, genres, keywords into a single column tags.

2.) Vectorization:
I have used Bag of Words to tokenize the input sequences. I have used CountVectorizer for this.

3.) Cosine Similarity:
I calculated cosine similarity among each vectors and stored them as a matrix similarity.
